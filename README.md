# This project is dead. Maybe I will pick it up in the future again (probably not lol) but then Id reimplement everything. 

Got around 60% accuarcy which is good enough for starters. :D 

Fooling around with pytorch and nn. 
- GPU is automatically detected and used.
- images are generated by myself (will maybe compare vs Kaggle Images in the future) audio_data#generateImages()
    - it will automatically DELETE existing images folder and create new images.

Source test data: https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

# TO-DO

- Compare image recognition vs directly feeding the data in the nn (eg mean of features) 
- image augumentation? --> inc acc?
- audio data augumentation? (manipulate distortion & pitches)--> inc acc?
- image augumenation vs audio data augumentation   what is more efficient?
- try torch audio to load the data
